    "# **Dream 7B 微调项目报告**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **一、 扩散模型 (Diffusion Model) 架构分析与研究**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. 核心思想**\n",
    "\n",
    "扩散模型的设计哲学源于热力学，其核心是通过两个对称的过程实现数据生成：\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **前向过程 (Forward Process):** **注入噪声**直至其变为纯粹噪声的“破坏”过程。\n",
    "*   **逆向过程 (Reverse Process):** **去除噪声**直至恢复出结构化数据的“生成”过程。\n",
    "\n",
    "通过学习如何逆转这个“破坏”过程，模型本质上就学会了目标数据的内在分布规律，从而能够生成全新的、高质量的样本。\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. 前向过程 (Forward Process / Diffusion Process)**\n",
    "\n",
    "这是一个不可学习的、固定的马尔可夫过程，其关键特性如下：\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **目标：** 将一个原始数据样本在 T 个时间步内逐步添加高斯噪声。\n",
    "*   **过程：** 随着时间步 `t` 的推进，数据样本会逐渐丧失其结构化信息。当 `t` 趋近于 `T` 时，样本最终会收敛为纯粹的噪声。\n",
    "*   **意义：** 此过程并非无用功。它为模型的训练提供了至关重要的监督信号。在任意时间步 `t`，我们都能精确地得到**“加噪后的数据”**与**“所添加的噪声”**这样成对的训练样本，这是逆向过程能够成功学习的基础。\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. 逆向过程 (Reverse Process / Denoising Process)**\n",
    "\n",
    "这是**模型真正需要学习的部分**。其工作机制可以分解为：\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **目标：** 从一个纯粹的高斯噪声样本开始，通过 T 个时间步，逐步将其还原成一个符合真实数据分布的清晰样本。\n",
    "*   **核心机制：** 在每一个时间步 `t`，一个**深度神经网络**会接收当前的含噪数据 `x_t`，并被训练来**预测在该步骤中被添加的噪声 `ε`**。\n",
    "*   **迭代去噪：** 通过从当前数据 `x_t` 中减去模型预测出的噪声 `ε`，我们就能得到一个稍微“干净”一点的数据 `x_{t-1}`。这个过程被迭代 T 次，最终得出清晰样本。\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. 与语言模型的结合（dLLM）\n",
    "\n",
    "Dream 7B 作为一种创新的扩散型语言模型，向我们介绍了概念**离散的词元空间 (Discrete Token Space)**。它同样包含：\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **前向过程 (Masking):** 对应于传统扩散模型的“加噪”，Dream 7B 的前向过程是将文本序列中的部分或全部词元（token）替换为特殊的 **`[MASK]`** 标记。噪声由离散的`[MASK]`词元替代连续的高斯值。\n",
    "*   **逆向过程 (Predicting):** 这是模型的核心生成任务。模型接收一个被掩码的文本序列，并**并行地预测所有 `[MASK]` 位置上最有可能的真实词元**。这个去噪（预测）过程会迭代进行多次：每一次迭代，模型都会基于上一轮的预测结果，生成一个置信度更高、`[MASK]` 标记更少的新序列，直至整个文本被完整恢复。\n",
    "\n",
    "这种在离散空间中直接进行“掩码与预测”的扩散方法，是其与传统自回归语言模型（如GPT）的关键区别，赋予了其并行生成和迭代优化的独特能力。"

We have $a \\\\times b = N$.\\nSince $\\\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, the prime factors of $N$ are distributed between $a$ and $b$ such that no prime factor is shared by both.\\n\\nConsider the prime factorization of $N = 20!$.\\nLet $N = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\\\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers and $e_i \\\\ge 1$.\\n\\nSince $a \\\\times b = N$ and $\\\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, each prime power $p_i^{e_i}$ must be entirely a factor of $a$ or entirely a factor of $b$.\\nFor each prime power $p_i^{e_i}$, there are two choices: either $p_i^{e_i}$ is a factor of $a$, or $p_i^{e_i}$ is a factor of $b$.\\nSince there are $k$ distinct prime factors, there are $2^k$ ways to distribute the prime power factors between $a$ and $b$.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\\n\\nFirst, a rational number between 0 and 1 can be written as a fraction \\\\(\\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\) where \\\\(0 < a < b\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are coprime positive integers. The product \\\\(a \\\\times b\\\\) is said to be equal to 20! which is a huge number. So I need to find all pairs \\\\((a, b)\\\\) such that \\\\(a \\\\times b = 20!\\\\), \\\\(0 < a < b\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\\\). Then count how many such pairs exist.\\n\\nLet me break down the problem.\\n\\nGiven that \\\\(a \\\\times b = 20!\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\\\), it means that \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are coprime factors of 20!. So they form a coprime pair whose product is 20!. Such pairs are related to the divisors of 20! where each pair consists of two coprime numbers.\\n\\nBut since the fraction is between 0 and 1, \\\\(a < b\\\\). So for each such coprime pair where \\\\(a < b\\\\), we have a distinct rational number, and each of these would satisfy \\\\(a \\\\times b = 20!\\\\). Hence, the problem reduces to finding the number of coprime pairs \\\\((a, b)\\\\) where \\\\(a \\\\times b = 20!\\\\) and \\\\(a < b\\\\).\\n\\nNow, how do I count such pairs?\\n\\nAlternatively, in number theory, this is equivalent to counting the number of ways to write 20! as a product of two coprime numbers, \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\), with \\\\(a < b\\\\). Since \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are coprime, each prime factor in 20! must go entirely to \\\\(a\\\\) or entirely to \\\\(b\\\\). Hence, each coprime pair corresponds to a subset of the prime factors of 20!, where \\\\(a\\\\) is the product of the primes in the subset and \\\\(b\\\\) is the product of the remaining primes. However, since 20! is not just the product of primes, but the product of primes raised to various powers. Wait, so maybe I need to rethink that.\\n\\nWait, actually 20! has prime factors with exponents. For example, 2^18, 3^8, 5^4, etc., up to the primes less than or equal to 20. But if I need two coprime numbers \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) such that \\\\(a \\\\times b = 20!\\\\), then each of the prime powers in the factorization of 20! must go entirely to one of the numbers \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\). So for each prime factor, we assign it to either \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\), but not both.\\n\\nTherefore, the number of such coprime pairs is \\\\(2^k\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the number of distinct prime factors of 20!.\\n\\nBut wait, 20! has prime factors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. Let me check. The primes less than or equal to 20 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. So that\\'s 8 primes. Therefore, the number of coprime pairs would be \\\\(2^8 = 256\\\\), but each pair is counted twice except when \\\\(a = b\\\\). But since \\\\(a \\\\times b = 20!\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are coprime, \\\\(a = 1\\\\) and \\\\(b = 20!\\\\), or vice versa; however, \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) can\\'t be equal unless 20! is a square, which it is not (since exponents in its prime factorization are all even? Wait, 20! has exponents:\\n\\nLet me do prime factorization of 20!.\\n\\nTo compute the exponents of primes in 20!:\\n\\nFor prime 2: floor(20/2) + floor(20/4) + floor(20/8) + floor(20/16) =10+5+2+1=18\\n\\nFor prime 3: floor(20/3) + floor(20/9) + floor(20/27)=6 +2 +0=8\\n\\nFor prime 5: floor(20/5) + floor(20/25)=4 +0=4\\n\\nPrime 7: floor(20/7) + floor(20/49)=2 +0=2\\n\\nPrimes 11: floor(20/11)=1, similar for 13, 17, 19. So yes, primes 11, 13, 17, 19 each have exponent 1 in 20!.\\n\\nSo exponents are: 18 (2), 8 (3), 4 (5), 2 (7), 1 (11), 1 (13), 1 (17), 1 (19)\\n\\nSince all exponents except for 2,3,5,7 have exponent 1, and exponents for 2,3,5,7 are even and odd.\\n\\nTherefore, 20! is not a perfect square because, for example, exponent of 3 is 8 (even), exponent of 2 is 18 (even), but exponent of 5 is 4 (even), 2 (7) (even?), no 7 has exponent 2? Wait for 7: floor(20/7)=2 (floor(20/49) = 0), so that\\'s exponent 2.\\n\\nWait, 7^2 divides into 20! but 7^3 does not.\\n\\nBut exponent of 7 is 2, which is even. Wait a second. Then primes 11, 13,17,19 have exponent 1.\\n\\nSo primes 2: 18, 3: 8, 5:4,7:2, which are all even? Wait, 18,8,4,2, which are even. Wait, that would mean the only primes with odd exponents are 11,13,17,19? Wait, but their exponents are 1, which is odd. Actually, wait nvm, the exponents for 2,3,5,7 are even?\\n\\nWait floor operations:\\n\\nFor prime 2: 20/2=10, 10 terms, then 5, 2, 1.\\n\\nWait, 18 for exponent of 2. Which is even. 3: 8, even. 5: 4, even. 7:2, even. Then 11,13,17,19 each only once. So actually, their exponents are odd (each exponent is 1). Therefore, 20! can be written as (2^18)(3^8)(5^4)(7^2)(11^1)(13^1)(17^1)(19^1). So exponents of the primes 11,13,17,19 are 1 (each odd?), and the others are even. Thus, 20! is not a square because it has primes raised to odd exponents. Therefore, there are no solutions where \\\\(a = b\\\\). So all coprime pairs with \\\\(a \\\\times b = 20!\\\\) must have \\\\(a \\\\neq b\\\\). Hence, total coprime pairs are \\\\(2^{8}\\\\), where each prime can be assigned to either \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\). But since each assignment corresponds to a unique pair (a,b) or (b,a), but we have \\\\(a \\\\times b = 20!\\\\) and \\\\(a < b\\\\), so pairs (a,b) and (b,a) are distinct unless a=b, which here is impossible. Therefore, total number of unordered pairs would be \\\\(2^{8 - 1} =128\\\\), since each pair is counted twice. But actually, since we are considering ordered pairs where a < b, then we need to divide the total by 2.\\n\\nWait, but the problem says \"how many rational numbers between 0 and 1\", each such number is associated with a unique pair (a,b) where a < b. So the count is half the number of coprime ordered pairs, or is it?\\n\\nWait, but perhaps the counting is as follows: Each prime in 20!\\'s factorization (if each prime exponent is assigned to a or b) gives 2^k possibilities, with k the number of distinct prime factors. Each distinct assignment gives a coprime pair (a,b) where a and b are products of assigned primes. However, since for each such assignment, either a < b or a > b. Since the assignments consist of selecting a subset S of the set of prime factors, then a = product_{p in S} p^{e_p}, and b = 20! / a.\\n\\nBut in order to count the pairs where a < b, I just need to calculate how many subsets S of the prime factors (or rather, assigning each prime to a... The confusion is that since 20! is not squareful; but even so, does assigning a prime to a versus b affect the magnitude of a compared to b?\\n\\nWait, 20! is a fixed number, but how is a related to b? a is a product of some prime powers (all primes assigned to a must go completely into a) and then b is 20! / a, with all the remaining prime powers. Therefore, a can vary from 1 up to sqrt(20!) if possible, but since 20! is not a square, it\\'s a bit ambiguous. For each a < b, the corresponding b > a would be 20! / a. Therefore, the number of pairs with a < b is equal to the number of possible a such that a < 20!a^{-1}, which simplifies to a^2 < 20! or a < sqrt(20!). Therefore, the number of such a is half the total number of divisors, adjusted for square factors. However, we are dealing specifically here with coprime pairs (a,b) such that a*b=20!, and gcd(a,b)=1, so a and b are products of complementary prime factors.\\n\\nTherefore, for each subset of the prime factors of 20!, there corresponds one unique a (by multiplying all primes in the subset) and one unique b (multiplying the rest).\\n\\nSince each subset has a unique complement, the number of unordered pairs is indeed 2^{k-1}, where k is primes. But, since prime factors with exponents: Wait, but each prime is either included in a or not, so there are 2 choices per prime. Since 20! has 8 distinct prime factors (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19), each of which must be assigned fully to a or b, the number of ordered pairs (a,b) would be 2^8 = 256. However, because 20! is not a square (due to the primes with exponents as discussed earlier), there are no pairs where a = b. Hence, each unordered pair {a, b} is counted twice in the 256 ordered pairs.\\n\\nBut in our problem, we need the ordered pairs (a, b) where a < b, which is exactly half of the total ordered pairs (excluding the a = b case, which does not exist here). Therefore, the total number should be 256 / 2 = 128. But hold on, is this correct?\\n\\nWait, perhaps not quite. Since not all assignments will satisfy a < b, even for coprime divisors. Wait, but in reality, since a is a number composed by assigning primes to a (possibly a = product of primes raised to their exponents).. Wait, confusion arises here.\\n\\nWait, actually, we need to be precise. When we say that a and b are coprime with a*b=20!, then a and b must be square-free? No, that\\'s not correct. Each must have all primes exponents from 20! For example, if I assign prime 2 to a, then a would have 2 to the 18th power, whereas 3 might be assigned to b, so the exponent of 3 would be to the 8th in b. Wait, but a and b have exponents for the primes? Wait no, in the problem statement, the numerator and denominator (a and b) when written in lowest terms. If the original rational number is  in lowest terms, that means that a and b are coprime, hence exponents of primes in 20! are distributed completely to a or to b. Thus, the product a*b=20! means that each prime\\'s exponent in 20! is divided between a and b? But since they must be coprime, it\\'s either assigned entirely to a or to b.\\n\\nTherefore, 20! can be considered as a product of coprime numbers a and b for which all primes in a share no primes with b. Therefore, the coprime pairs (a,b) with a*b=20! are in correspondence with the subsets of the set of prime factors of 20!.\\n\\nEach prime factor must go either to a or to b, since a and b are coprime. Therefore, each prime is assigned to a or b, so the total number of such assignments is 2^8 (since there are 8 distinct primes in 20!\\'s factorization). Each assignment produces a unique coprime pair (a, b) with a*b=20!.\\n\\nBut here, (a,b) is an ordered pair, hence assignments where primes are assigned to a vs. assigned to b result in a different ordered pair.\\n\\nHowever, our problem wants rational numbers between 0 and 1, which corresponds to a < b (because 0 < a/b < 1 implies a < b). Therefore, the number of such fractions is equal to the number of coprime divisor pairs (a,b) where a*b=20! and a < b. Since each coprime pair (a,b) with a < b corresponds to the exact opposite pair (b,a) with b > a. Therefore, half of the total ordered coprime pairs (excluding duplicates) would give the count.\\n\\nBut since in each such coprime pair of divisors, (a,b) and (b,a) are distinct (since we\\'re considering ordered pairs), then the number of coprime pairs with a < b is exactly half of the total number of coprime pairs. Since the total number is 2^8=256 (since each prime is either assigned to a or to b, 2 choices per prime), but the assignment where a = 1 (all primes assigned to b) and b = 20! (there\\'s exactly one such case), and a can be 1, then proceed. Wait, 1 is the product of assigning no primes to a (all primes to b), so that\\'s included.\\n\\nBut if a and b can be written as a = 1 and b = 20!, yes, that\\'s a coprime pair, likewise a=2^18 and b= (20!)/2^18 which is still an integer. Similarly for all subsets. Wait, but when we write a and b as coprime factors, the way I\\'m thinking is that the assignment is of each prime as a binary choice (to a or to b). So 2^8 equals 256 possible assignments, and each assignment defines a unique coprime pair (a,b) where a * b=20!. Since each assignment is unique, each ordered pair is distinct, even if a and b are swapped.\\n\\nSince such ordered pairs can have a < b or a > b, so then to get the (a,b) with a < b, we divide by 2, which gives 128.\\n\\nBut wait, can it be? Let me check with a smaller factorial.\\n\\nSuppose instead of 20!, take a simpler case. Let me check with n = 6. Then 6! = 720. Let\\'s ask for rationals between 0 and 1 with product a*b=720, gcd(a,b)=1, a < b. Then 720 prime factorization: 2^4 *3^2 *5^1. So number of primes is 3 (2,3,5). Each can be assigned to a or b, so 2^3=8 coprime pairs. Then half of them, 4 pairs would have a < b. Let\\'s check. Possible assignments:\\n\\n1. Assign none to a: a =1, b=720. Then 1*720=720.\\n\\n   a=1 < b=720 : valid.\\n\\n2. Assign 2 to a, others to b: a=16 (2^4), b=45 (3^2 *5). gcd(16,45)=1. Check a=16 < b=45? 16 <45: yes.\\n\\n3. Assign 3 to a, others to b: a=9 (3^2), b=80 (16 *5). Check 9 <80: yes.\\n\\n4. Assign 5 to a, others to b: a=5, b= 144 (16*9). 5 <144: yes.\\n\\n5. Assign 2 and 3 to a: a=16*9=144, b=5. Now a=144 and b=5. But 144 >5, so would be considered as a different pair if ordered. But in assignments, assigning to a or b. So here, ordering matters. Therefore, for the purpose of our count, pairing where 2 and 3 are assigned to a would create a=144, b=5, but since a < b is required, this does NOT count. So the assignment of primes {2,3} to a would result in a product a=144, b=5. To reach a < b, the valid pairs where assignment to a. Wait, This seems miscalculous.\\n\\nWait no, in 720\\'s case. Assign 2 and 3 to a would mean a=(2^4)*(3^2)=144, while assigning rest (5) to b=5. Since 144 and 5: gcd(144,5)=1, and ab=144*5=720 indeed. But a=144>5, so this would not satisfy a < b, therefore this assignment would not be included in the count. So how do we reconcile the count.\\n\\nIf the number of coprime assignments (with order) is 2^3=8, but how many of those assignments result in a < b?\\n\\nSo for 720, with prime factors 2,3,5:\\n\\nThe 8 assignments:\\n\\n1. Assign none to a => a=1, b=720 (1 <720: yes)\\n\\n2. Assign 2 to a => a=16, b=45 (16 <45: yes)\\n\\n3. Assign 3 to a =>a=9, b=80 (9 <80: yes)\\n\\n4. Assign 5 to a =>a=5, b=144 (5 <144: yes)\\n\\n5. Assign 2 and3 to a => a=144, b=5 (a >b: no)\\n\\n6. Assign 2 and5 to a => a=16*5=80, b=9 (80 >9: no)\\n\\n7. Assign3 and5 to a => a=9*5=45, b=16 (45>16: no)\\n\\n8. Assign all three primes to a =>a=720, b=1 (a> b: no)\\n\\nTherefore, out of 8 assignments, 4 result in a < b and 4 in a >b. So when 720 is not a square, which it is not (since exponent of 5 is 1, odd), thus the case a=b is not possible, hence the number of ordered coprime pairs with a < b is half the total, which is 4. So in general, the answer seems to be half of the number of coprime ordered pairs.\\n\\nTherefore, again, number for 20! would be 2^8 /2 =128. So 128 coprime pairs (a,b) with a < b. However, perhaps there\\'s a problem here.\\n\\nWait, in the case when assignments are made for each prime, but, in the original problem, the numerator and denominator are reduced to lowest terms. Which in original fraction it\\'s not required that the numerator and denominator multiply to 20!; rather, the reduced fraction \\\\(\\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\) has the product a*b which is 20 factorial. Wait, that needs to be resolved.\\n\\nWait, perhaps that\\'s the confusion. The original number is some fraction as part of between 0 and 1. When written in lowest terms, numerator a and denominator b must satisfy that. However, a different way to phrase this is: a is numerator and b is denominator in reduced form (so gcd(a, b)=1), and when you compute the product a*b, this product is equal to 20!.\\n\\nHence, the question is equivalent to: how many pairs (a, b) are there with gcd(a, b)=1, 0 < a < b, and a * b = 20!\\n\\nWhich translates as, (since 20! is fixed and a*b=20!), how many ways can 20! be split into two coprime factors a and b, both positive integers, a < b.\\n\\nAnd this number is equal to 2^{k -1}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of 20!.\\n\\nBut since the number of distinct prime factors of 20! is 8 (since primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,13,17,19). Hence, 2^{8 -1}= 128. Hence, result. Wait, this would be 2^{k-1}=128. Alternatively, total number of subsets is 2^8=256, each ordered pairs. Taking half because a < b hence 256/2=128. So confirms.\\n\\nBut let me check with the 6! example. For 6!, which had instead three distinct prime factors (2,3,5), number of coprime pairs where a < b is 4 (by explicit count above). But 2^{3-1}= 4 correct. Hence, Therefore, the formula is 2^{k -1).\\n\\nHence, for 20! with 8 prime factors, number of coprime pairs with a < b and a*b=20! is 2^{8-1}=128, which seems correct.\\n\\nBut Wait, what about multiplicity. For example, 1 and 720 were co-prime (a=1, b=720). Then you had 16 and 45, and 9 and 80, and 5 and 144. How is it multiplicative, related to the number of prime factors?\\n\\nYes, but 6! is 720, and had three prime factors. The number of coprime pairs a < b where a*b=720 is 4, which is 2^{3-1}=4.\\n\\nSimilarly, if n is a square-free number, which 720 is not square-free (as 720=16*45=24^2*5).\\n\\nBut in general, n! will have prime factors multiplicities.\\n\\nBut our problem states n=20. So 20!.\\n\\nRegardless of the multiplicities (since in order for a and b to be coprime, the entire allocation of each prime has to go to one factor). Therefore, how primes are assigned has a per-prime dependence.\\n\\nWait, so since for each prime, regardless of exponent (even or odd), we must give it entirely to a or b, which leads to these coprime pairs. So seems that the number is, in general, 2^{k} ordered coprime pairs (a,b), and because n! is not a square (unless for example primes with even exponents), it depends. As with N! for N>1.\\n\\nWait, for N >=2, N! has primes p <= N. The multiplicities (exponents) can be even or odd, but sqrt(N!) is irrational unless all exponents are even. But which cannot happen because, for instance, prime number p_0 (which appears once in N! for primes N/2 < p_0 <=N). For example, primes between N/2 and N cannot come in pairs. So hence exponents for primes bigger than N/2 will be 1. Therefore, odd. Hence sqrt(N!) is not integer. Hence N! is not a square. Therefore, the number of divisors N! So, accordingly, the number of such co-prime pairs is 2^{k} with k primes, leading to 2^k ordered pairs. Thus, the number of unordered pairs, accounting for swapping a and b, is 2^{k-1}. So for N =6, with three primes, 2^(3 -1)=4, which matches what we saw for 720.\\n\\nTherefore, back to the original problem. It\\'s 2^{8-1}=128. Thus the answer is 128. Hence, the answer is 128?\\n\\nBut to confirm this, perhaps think again. The question is a bit more precise: it says that the original rational number between 0 and 1 is written in reduced form, and you multiply numerator and denominator (from reduced form), and that product is equal to 20!. So that equivalent to saying find all reduced fractions a/b where 0 < a/b <1 and a*b=20!. Hence, equivalent to coprime pairs (a,b) with a*b=20! and a < b.\\n\\nThus previous logic applies; each such pair is obtained by assignment of primes to a or b, since a and b need to be coprime. Assign each prime of 20! to either a or b. So 8 primes in 20! Each has two choices. Hence no. of pairs (a,b), ordered is 2^8=256. Since none of the ordered have pairs a=b, each unordered pair is counted as (a,b) and (b,a). The number with a < b is half of the total pairs, so 256/2 =128. Hence 128 such numbers. Therefore, The answer is 128, corresponding to \\\\boxed{128}?  Or wait, wait prime factors of 20! Are 8 primes, 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19. So 8, so k=8. so answer is 2^(8-1)=128.\\n\\nDoes that make sense?\\n\\nBut wait, an alternative approach: suppose we recognize that each coprime pair (a,b) with a*b = N is equivalent to choosing a subset S of the prime factors of N, hence product(a)= product of primes in S (with exponents in N\\'s prime factorization), which requires multiplicativity. For each prime p | N, assign all the exponents in p to a or to b, but not both, since a and b must be coprime.\\n\\nThus, since N=20! has prime factors each occurring to some exponent. Each prime can be assigned to a or to b therefore 2^k combinations. Here k is 8. Each combination defines an ordered pair (a,b). If a < b, then we want the number of assignments where the product a < b. But since N is fixed, that is a < N /a, so a^2 <N. But is there a simple relation between the subset of primes assigned to a and whether a < sqrt(N)?\\n\\nNo, not really even, as a could be a product of different primes, and how that relates?  For example, consider assigning the small primes to a; that would make a big but depending on which primes. But here is the crux: instead of trying to group, this is again difficult to calculate by separate method; but via generating the coprimality by prime division, and noting in N! is fixed, so that the only way to a*b=N!:\\n\\nSince a and b are coprime.\\n\\nHence equivalence between choices over subsets of primes.\\n\\nHence, since ordered coprimes, 2^pairs.\\n\\nEach with a Unique Subsets of primes assigned to a.\\n\\nHence, since ordering for each subset, half will be such that the a is less than b.\\n\\nHence if done for k primes, because N! is not a square, then exactly half of those subsets gives a*a less than N! , that is, a < sqrt(N!).\\n\\nBut for all possible assignments, the total number of cases where a < b should be equal to 2^{k-1} as reasoned before.\\n\\nTherefore, the previous answer 128 must be correct, hence The answer would be 128.\\n\\nBut before  closing, verifying with our 6! example was key.\\n\\nIn the 6! example (k=3 primes), number of coprime pairs with a < b=4=2^{3-1}.\\n\\nAnd with actual calculation matching.\\n\\nTherefore, Conclusion:\\n\\nThe number of rational numbers between 0 and 1 such that when written in lowest terms as a/b, the product of numerator and denominator is 20!=1×2×3...×20 is given by 2^{number of prime factors of 20! -1} =2^{8-1}=128.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\n\\\\boxed{128}\\n', 'deepseek_attempt': 'Given a rational number between 0 and 1, we need to write it as a fraction in lowest terms \\\\(\\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\) and calculate the product of the resulting numerator and denominator.

    "  为验证整个技术管线的正确性，并对不同的微调策略进行评估，我在64个样本的小数据集上，分别使用**全参数微调 (Full Fine-Tuning, FFT)** 和 **QLoRA** 两种技术路线。\n",
    "\n",
    "- **实验数据与分析：**\n",
    "  两次试验的训练损失（Training Loss）被记录如下。通过对这组并行数据的细致分析，可以清晰地揭示两种范式的内在特性与差异。\n",

    "| 训练步骤 (Step) | 全参数微调 Loss | QLoRA Loss | 数据驱动的分析解读 |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |\n",
    "| 1 | 0.3631 | 0.3216 | **初始损失 (Initial Loss):** 两者初始Loss在同一数量级，表明模型起点状态一致。QLoRA因4-bit量化引入的微小精度损失，其初始值略低，这在理论上是可能的。 |\n",
    "| 2 | **0.0393 (↓)** | 0.2925 | **收敛速度 (Convergence Speed):** FFT展现出极高的收敛速度，Loss在一个步骤内下降了近90%。这体现了调动全部参数进行更新的巨大效能。QLoRA的下降则更为平缓。 |\n",
    "| 3 | 0.0163 | 0.2851 | **收敛轨迹 (Convergence Trajectory):** FFT在极少的步骤内迅速将Loss降低至一个很低的水平。QLoRA则呈现出一种更稳定、更渐进的下降轨迹。 |\n",
    "| 4 | 0.0138 | 0.2829 | **持续优化:** 两种方法都在持续学习，FFT已进入精细调优阶段，而QLoRA仍存续在主要下降通道中。 |\n",
    "| 5 | 0.0104 | 0.2611 | **阶段性低点:** FFT的Loss已接近0.01。QLoRA稳定地达到了其在此次试验中的性能较优区间。 |\n",
    "| 6 | 0.2162 (↑) | 0.5439 (↑)| **损失波动性 (Loss Volatility):** 两者都在同一步骤遭遇了损失的大幅反弹，这符合小批量随机梯度下降的特性，表明该数据批次可能是一个“困难样本”(hard case)。 |\n",
    "| 7 | 0.0142 | 0.2613 | **鲁棒性与恢复:** 两者都表现出良好的鲁棒性，在遭遇损失尖峰后能迅速恢复，将Loss拉回到正常水平。 |\n",
    "| 8 | 0.0104 | 0.3337 (↑)| **最终训练损失 (Final Training Loss):** FFT最终收敛在一个极低的Loss区间，展现了其在小样本上的**极高模型容量和拟合能力**。QLoRA则收敛在一个相对较高的Loss区间。 |\n",

    "- **结论与评估：**\n",
    "  1.  **流程验证成功：** 两次试验的成功运行，证明了环境配置、模型加载、数据预处理，到两种不同范式的训练参数设置是正确的。\n",
    "  2.  **范式差异的量化体现：**\n",
    "      *   **全参数微调 (FFT)** 在理论上拥有无与伦比的**学习效率和拟合能力**。它能够在极少的训练样本上，迅速将训练损失降低到一个极低的水平。\n",
    "      *   **QLoRA** 通过冻结绝大部分模型参数，本质上扮演了一个**强正则化器**的角色。这限制了模型在小样本上的极致拟合能力，因此其训练损失显著高于FFT。然而，这种限制恰恰是其优势所在：它不仅**极大地降低了资源消耗**，使得微调成为可能。"

    "### 发现 #2：全量数据训练过程中的学习动态与过拟合的最终验证\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "在对`Dream-7B`模型应双重Dropout + 权重减）后，我成功地在全部1000条样本上，进行了一次完整的、3个世代的全参数微本。\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 学习过程的阶段性分析\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "通过对375个训练步骤的日志进行分析，可以将整个学习过程清晰地划分为三个 distinct 阶段：\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1.  **第一阶段：快速收敛与高度波动期 (Steps 5-130)**\r\n",
    "    *   **观察：** 训练在启动后，展现了极高的学习效率。损失值从初始的`0.1774`，在极短的时间内便迅速收敛到了`0.000xxx`的极低水平。\r\n",
    "    *   **同时，** 这个阶段也伴随着**剧烈的损失波动**。例如，在Step 20-25和Step 50-55之间，都出现了损失的显著反弹。\r\n",
    "    *   **解读：** 这证明了全参数微调模式巨大的模型容量使其能够飞速地拟合数据。然而，这也使其对不同数据批次的“个性”极其敏感，导致了学习过程的内在不稳定性。\r\n",
    ".  **第二阶段：灾难性过拟合的临界点 (Steps 135-190)**\r\n",
    "    *   **观察：** *，一个决定性的事件发生了：训练损失**第一次精确地达到了`0.000000`**。在此之后，零损失的现象开始零星出现（如Step 190）。\r\n",
    " 合**的、无可辩驳的最终信号。它标志着模型已经从“学习规律”的阶段，跨入了**“完美记忆训练样本”**的阶段。在处理这些特定批次时，模型给出的预测与标准答案**完全一致**。\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3.  **第三阶段：完全记忆与泛化能力丧失 (Steps 190-375)**\r\n",
    "    *   **观察：** 在训练的后半程，**零损失的现象变得越来越频繁**，最终在训练的最后阶段成为常态。\r\n",
    "    *   **解读：** 这证明了我们部署的“三位一体”正则化策略，对于一个拥有70亿自由参数、却只学习1000个样本的模型来说，其约束力**是完全不足的**。模型的巨大容量，使其过拟合的“惯性”无可阻挡。到训练结束时，可以合理地断定，该模型已经将训练集中的绝大部分样本“背诵”了下来。\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### 最终结论\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "这次最终的、成功的全参数微调实验，以一种定量答案驳的方式，为我的技术选型提供不适用判决书”：\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "*   **全参数微调的“诅咒”：** 尽管拥有上最强的学习“大模型、小数据”这一典型场景，其最化能力**为代价，换取了在训练集上的“虚假完美”。因此，尽管我们成功地让它跑完了全程，但其产出的模型，对于任何需要推理未知问题的真实世界任务来说，**是无效的**。\r\n",
    "\r",
    "失败   **QLoRA的优越性：** 这次FFT的“成功”，从反面最有力地证明了QLoRA的价值。QLoRA通过其内在的、极其强大的参数冻结机制，扮演了一个**架构级别的强正则化器**。它强制模型去学习更通用、更鲁棒的规律，从而避免了这种灾难性的过拟合。因此，尽管QLoRA的训练损失更高，但可以预期，它在未知数据上的**泛化性能将远超**这个“完美拟合”的全参数微调模型。"
